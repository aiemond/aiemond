### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a learning-obsessed engineering student. Man of many abilities (modest brag): a data science enthusiast, designer, and programmer who learned everything on his own. I also like selling folks outlandish ideas! I also like pitching wacky ideas to folks.

  ðŸŒ± Currently: I'm studying dbt, analytics engineering, bayesian statistics, a/b testing, and basically how to be a better analyst. 
  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm extremely witty (at least sometimes), and I have a thing for mechanical keyboards.
