### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a learning-obsessed engineering student. Man of many abilities (modest brag): a data science enthusiast, designer, and programmer who learned everything on his own. I also like selling folks outlandish ideas! I also like pitching wacky ideas to folks.

  ðŸŒ± Currently: I'm studying Deep Learning, analytics engineering and basically how to be a better analyst.
  
  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm extremely witty (at least sometimes), and I have a thing for mechanical keyboards.

Machine/Deep Learning Tools & Methods using PyTorch:
 - Implementation of gradient descent and PyTorch built-in functions for improving the efficiency of training a linear regression model.
 - Operate with images in PyTorch using different datasets, covering the steps of dataset splitting, creating PyTorch models, interpreting model outputs,      selecting evaluation metrics, setting up a training loop with validation, testing the model, and saving/loading model checkpoints.
 - The ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel          densities) and outputs (class probabilities).
 - Carrying out the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification, display batches of images in a grid using torchvision and create a convolutional neural          network using (nn.Conv2d) and (nn.MaxPool2d) layers.
 - Training to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in PyTorch.
