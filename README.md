### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a learning-obsessed engineering student. Man of many abilities (modest brag): a data science enthusiast, designer, and programmer who learned everything on his own. I also like selling folks outlandish ideas! I also like pitching wacky ideas to folks.

  ðŸŒ± Currently: I'm studying Deep Learning, analytics engineering and basically how to be a better analyst.
  
  âš¡ Fun fact: I'm extremely witty (at least sometimes), and I have a thing for mechanical keyboards.

Machine/Deep Learning Tools & Methods using PyTorch & TensorFlow :
 - Implementation of gradient descent and built-in functions for improving the efficiency of training a linear regression model.
 - Operate with images using different datasets, covering the steps of dataset splitting, creating models, interpreting model outputs, selecting            evaluation metrics, setting up a training loop with validation, testing the model, and saving/loading model checkpoints.
 - The ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel        densities) and outputs (class probabilities).
 - Carrying out the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification, display batches of images in a grid and create a convolutional neural network.
 - Training to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
 - Music Generation with RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks).



Deep Learning Projects in NLP (Natural Language Processing):
 - Social Media sentiment analysis using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for NaiveBayes Classifier.
 - Amazon reviews sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
 - RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-Training Approach) to predict and analyse overall sentiment.
 - The Transformers Pipeline to predict possible outcomes from Huggingface Pipeline of input text dataset.
