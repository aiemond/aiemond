### Hello ğŸ‘‹

I'm an engineering student that loves to learn. Man of many talents (humble brag): A self taught designer, programmer and data science enthusiast. I also love selling people crazy ideas!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - dbt, analytics engineering, bayesian statistics, a/b testing and just being a better analyst.
âš¡ Fun fact: I have a thing for mechanical keyboards - an obsession really and I'm super funny (at least some times)!
